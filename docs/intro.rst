Getting Help

What are the Yandex.Tank components?
-------------------------------------
* ``Core`` - basic steps of test prepare, configuration, execution. Artifacts storing. Controls plugins/modules.
* ``Load generators`` -  modules that uses and controls load generators (load generators NOT included).
* ``Artifact uploaders`` - modules that uploads artifacts to external storages and services. 
* ``Handy tools`` - monitoring tools, console online screen, autostops and so on.

.. note::
  Using ``phantom`` as a load generator for mild load tests (less then 1000rps) an average laptop with 64bit Ubuntu (10.04/.../13.10) would be sufficient. The tank could be easily used in virtual machine if queries aren't too heavy and load isn't too big. Otherwise it is recommended to request a physical server or a more capable virtual machine from your admin.
